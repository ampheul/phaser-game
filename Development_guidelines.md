# Game
My idea for the game is a random card collecting game mashed with mashed with pokemon, mashed with tamagotchi.

Players will be able to encounter wild pokeCards which they can catch, and

## Implementation Details

### PokeCard details
Each card has
+ an image
    - it would also be nice to have animation
    - stats of the card could affect its color, size, dimensions, animations etc.
+ health
+ a list of attacks
+ a level
+ stats which affect attacks, such as attack, defense, so on.
    - it would be nice to demonstrate some properties visually
    - some do not change with level and are fixed by a die roll (like IVs in oldschool pokemon).
+ happiness
+ hunger

Ideally each card could be visited like a tamagotchi. It may be better to have many cards and put them in a "ranch" instead however so that you can select strategies based on how you want to raise your cards.

### Fights
Fights should feel like a tcg with a bit of pokemon mixed in. Games should be fast and use many cards.

Cards should have archetypes and abilities from a precreated list. Give the feeling of different strategies.
    + I would like there to be strategies based around the happiness stat of cards and hunger.
    + bosses should be scripted, ai is difficult :(
    + there should be multiplayer at some point
